# Experience with First Assignment

Writing an instructional guide for taking pictures was interesting. Because of my lack of experience writing on a plain text document, I had to frequently look up information on how to format certain portions so as to get them correctly organized and structured. 

One of things that I struggled with was remembering how to add a photo onto a repository. Realizing that you did go over this in class, I simply forgot the methods that had been used. When I researched it online, I found a variety of answers. I was at starbucks at the time, and worked singularly on this purpose for a very good portion of time. After a few hours and banging my head against the table, some of the workers probably grew worried for my well-being. I tried using the URL in all sorts of ways and even downloaded github desktop onto my laptop at one point because a website promised that it was the solution to all my problems. Either way, this was mostly a self-imposed issue, considering pictures were not required. 

Other than that, I had a fine time doing the assignment. It may have been useful to have a list of instructions for that issue though.

Also, the word count was very considerate. It was just enough for me to cover the important aspects of the subject, but not so mucht that I felt very overwhelmed.
